In game we have erc20-gold,silver,gem
erc721 knight,spacehip, shield. some of them are collection.
ERC1155 is able to support different kind of tokens.

- `constant` saves gas. it cannot be used inside constructor, but `immutable` can be

```js
    uint immutable pincode
    constructor(){
        pincode=1234
    }
```

You cannot use immutable type with strings and bytes because they both are dynamic arrays
pure functions do not read the storage
